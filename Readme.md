 Some professors are students who make their research studies and collect them in a PDF. They can make and edit their research articles.
 And Procode provides them a link to their own research article so they can add that in their LinkedIn profile.

### 5000 to  200 pages
 Nowadays,  college students do read different topics in different books which are in thousands of pages. they can make their own notes,
 which will help them in their exams and after them,  it will help their juniors and other students.

 A user can make his/her course in which he/she  wants to make. If a user wants to add videos, he can.  If you don't want to add video tutorials,
 then the user can only upload his notes one by one and arrange them in the manner of the book.
